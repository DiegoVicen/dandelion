===========================================
 ``dandelion`` - Rhyme detection in Python
===========================================

``dandelion`` is a package based on ``nltk`` that allows to detect rhymes in
English. Currently ``dandelion`` is experimental and its functionality has
still to be expanded and tested to be stable.

Currently, the package relies on the Carnegie Mellon University dictionary to
interpret and test for different rhymes. In the future, the aim is to develop a
model able to perform better analysis of rhyme schemes in paragraphs or
stanzas, as well as more general models that are able to cope with words that
do not appear in the CMU dictionary.

Installation
============

It is possible to download the latest version of ``dandelion`` using ``pip`` by
running ``pip install dandelion`` or to download one of the versions provided
by GitHub and run ``pip install`` locally.
